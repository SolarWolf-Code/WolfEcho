# WolfEcho

WolfEcho is a Discord bot that uses [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo/tree/master) to interact with the Discord API. It provides users with a variety of commands to interact with the bot and the server.


## TODO
- Add db support (mainly for `we/reminder`)
- Add bot other integration
- Add more commands
